## Testing for Anti-Lock Braking System

|SL No|Description|Input|Expected O/P|Actual O/P|Status|
|-----|------------|------------|------------|---------|----------|
|01|Determining the wheel’s speed on braking (reduction/stopping the wheel)|Signal builder input = Wheel slip (0.1 to 0.55) | Corresponding graphical output|Corresponding graphical output| Pass |
|02|Determining the vehicle’s speed on braking (reduction/stopping the vehicle)|Signal builder input = Wheel slip (0.1 to 0.55)| Corresponding graphical output|Corresponding graphical output| Pass | 
|03|Determining the relative slip between the wheel and the road|Signal builder input = Wheel slip (0.1 to 0.55)| Corresponding graphical output|Corresponding graphical output| Pass | 
|04|Determining the reduce in the slip distance on braking| Signal builder input = Wheel slip (0.1 to 0.55)| Corresponding graphical output|Corresponding graphical output| Pass |
