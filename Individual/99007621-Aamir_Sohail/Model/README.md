  Today, electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. Small vehicle makers, as well as big automobile manufacturers, are developing electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are a state strategic plan for the next decade because of the environmental demands, the competence of local power electronics technology, and the tardy development of new internal combustion engine-based cars. Electric vehicles of all brands and sizes are now available on the market. New electric vehicle parts and components are being developed in the electric car arena.
